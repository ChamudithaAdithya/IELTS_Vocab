    sampleBand8Answer:
      "On weekdays, my morning typically begins around six o'clock. The first thing I do is indulge in a brisk thirty-minute jog, which kickstarts my metabolism and clears my head. After a revitalizing shower, I prepare a nutritious breakfast while glancing through international news updates. I find that establishing this disciplined rhythm sets a productive, positive tone for the entire day ahead.",

A few years ago, I trekked through the Knuckles Mountain Range in central Sri Lanka. Being immersed in pristine biodiversity and interacting with humble agrarian communities was profoundly humbling.

    sampleBand8Answer:
      "I would like to recount the arduous journey of completing a half-marathon last November. Having led a predominantly sedentary lifestyle during the lockdown, my cardiovascular stamina had deteriorated significantly. Setting this ambitious target was essentially a commitment to reclaiming my physical vitality.\n\nThe preparation process was far from plain sailing. Around mid-way through my twelve-week training regimen, I suffered excruciating shin splints that threatened to derail my aspirations altogether. Instead of throwing in the towel, I sought professional physiotherapy, restructured my footwear, and embraced low-impact cross-training like swimming to maintain endurance.\n\nCrossing that finish line was an indescribably euphoric sensation. It wasn't merely about the finisher's medal; it was definitive proof that steadfast discipline and resilience can overcome debilitating self-doubt.",

      "Whenever I need to decompress after an exhausting day, I naturally gravitate toward acoustic folk or instrumental ambient melodies. There is something profoundly therapeutic about intricate acoustic guitar fingerpicking paired with gentle harmonies. It serves as an acoustic sanctuary, effectively filtering out urban noise and restoring my mental equilibrium.",
